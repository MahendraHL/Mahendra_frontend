        <p>We believe wedding photography should be unscripted, fun and timeless. On this page is a small portfolio from the hundreds of weddings we've been at over the last ten years. Our style is contemporary, fun and modern with an inclination towards moments in-between moments and classic portraiture. </p></center>
